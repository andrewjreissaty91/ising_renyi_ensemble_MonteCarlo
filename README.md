# ising_renyi_ensemble_MonteCarlo
Classical Monte Carlo code for the 2D Ising model in the RÃ©nyi ensemble, including code to find the maximum energy fixed point, which is attractive. See https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04005 for more info.

Note: this is a Fortran 90 code and gfortran was used for the compilation. The random.c file contains the random number generator that is used in the execution of the code.
